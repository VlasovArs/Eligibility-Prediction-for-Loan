# Eligibility-Prediction-for-Loan
The client's task is to find out whether it is worth giving a loan to the client.

My solution: I analyzed, processed the data, trained them on a neural network and got a forecast. The name of the target variable: "Loan_Status".

Result: The client received a decision within a day, my forecast helped him decide which clients should be given a loan and which ones should not, thereby I increased the profit of his bank.
